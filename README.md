# Training-and-Testing-on-IRIS-flower-dataset

Performing a simple exercise to train and test your machine on IRIS dataset. 

Python Scikit-learn has a number of datasets to work on real-world problems. 
We can download different datasets from UCI and Kaggle

IRIS dataset is one of the simplest dataset to start with. It comprises of 3 categories of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica

This contains 4 features sepal lengh, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
On the basis of these features we have to identify the category of the flower

This is a Supervised learning/Classification Task
